# What makes this code terrible

Since we this code contains repository pattern which somehow have potential disadvantages, Which are as follow

1: Increased Complexity: Implementing the Repository pattern introduces additional layers of abstraction, which can increase the overall complexity of the codebase. 

2: Boilerplate Code: The Repository pattern can lead to the creation of a lot of boilerplate code.

3: Maintenance Overhead: As the application evolves, maintaining both the repository and model classes can become cumbersome

4: Performance Impact: In some cases, the additional layer of abstraction introduced by the Repository pattern may lead to a slight performance impact.

5: Lack of Standardization: There is no strict standardization for implementing the Repository pattern;


#What makes it amazing code

Using services in Laravel offers several benefits that contribute to creating a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase. Following are the advantages.

1: Separation of Concerns: Services allow you to separate your business logic from your controllers and models. 

2: Code Reusability: By encapsulating specific functionality within a service, you can reuse that service across multiple controllers or parts of the application.

3: Testability: Services enhance testability because they abstract complex logic away from the controllers. 

4: Scalability: As your application grows, the separation of concerns provided by services allows you to add new features and functionality without modifying existing code extensively.

5: Error Handling and Logging: By encapsulating logic within services, you can implement consistent error handling and logging mechanisms.
